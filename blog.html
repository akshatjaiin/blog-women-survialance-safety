            <h2>Why Women's Safety Matters</h2>
            <p>Women’s safety is a fundamental issue that affects everyone. With rising incidents of harassment and violence, there is an urgent need for effective solutions to protect individuals in vulnerable situations. Technology can play a vital role in this, providing tools that can help detect distress signals and alert authorities or loved ones quickly.</p>

            <h2>Developing an SOS Detection System</h2>
            <p>An SOS detection system aims to recognize distress signals, such as hand gestures, and take appropriate actions. Here’s a step-by-step roadmap to building such a system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding the Requirements:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Objective: Detect SOS signals and identify the person in distress (preferably a woman) in a crowded area.</li>
                    <li>Challenges: Real-time processing, accuracy in detection, and speed.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Choosing the Right Technologies:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Optical Flow: Used for tracking movement across video frames. It helps to understand how objects (like hands) are moving, which is crucial for gesture recognition.</li>
                    <li>MediaPipe Hands: A model for hand gesture recognition. It can identify various hand gestures in real-time, such as SOS signals.</li>
                    <li>Gender Detection: To ensure that the SOS signal is from a woman, a gender classification model can be used.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Combining the Technologies:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Optical Flow Tracking</li>
                    <li>Hand Gesture Detection</li>
                    <li>Gender Classification</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>

        <section id="implementation-on-mobile-devices">
            <h2>Implementation on Mobile Devices</h2>
            <p>Performance Considerations: Mobile devices have limited processing power compared to desktops. Efficient use of models and optimization for mobile platforms is essential.</p>
            <p>Integration: Combine the models into a single mobile application that can process video feeds in real-time.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="evaluating-efficiency-and-accuracy">
            <h2>Evaluating Efficiency and Accuracy</h2>
            <p>Testing: Evaluate the system’s performance in different scenarios. Ensure it can accurately detect gestures and identify the person in various environments.</p>
            <p>Optimization: Fine-tune the models and code to achieve the best balance between speed and accuracy.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="why-optical-flow-and-heatmaps-might-be-used">
            <h2>Why Optical Flow and Heatmaps Might Be Used</h2>
            <p>Optical Flow: Provides a way to track motion and detect changes, crucial for recognizing hand gestures in real-time.</p>
            <p>Heatmaps: Useful for analyzing movement patterns over time. While not essential for real-time gesture detection, they can provide additional context and aid in understanding overall scene dynamics.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Creating an effective SOS detection system is a complex but rewarding task. By leveraging technologies like optical flow, MediaPipe Hands, and gender detection, we can develop systems that enhance safety and provide timely assistance. While integrating these technologies requires careful planning and optimization, the end result can be a powerful tool for ensuring women’s safety and responding to distress signals effectively.</p>
